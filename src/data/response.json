SMBC expects that delivery of the Notes will be made against\npayment therefor on or about January 12, 2017, which is the fifth New York business day\nfollowing the date of pricing of the Notes. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three\nbusiness days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,\npurchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing of the Notes or the next succeeding\nbusiness day will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle five New\nYork business days after pricing of the Notes, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time\nof any such trade to prevent failed settlement and should consult their own advisers.\n\nJanuary 5, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n"
