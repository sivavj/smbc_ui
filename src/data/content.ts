**Sensitivity Analysis**

**The following analysis is provided for information and illustrative purposes only. All information provided herein is**
**indicative, non-exhaustive and is based on certain assumptions and current market conditions and is subject to change**
**without notice.**

**It should not be relied on by Party B, and JPMorgan makes no representation or warranty regarding the accuracy or**
**completeness of the information herein. JPMorgan expressly disclaims any responsibility or reliance by Party B. In case of**
**any doubt, Party B must make an independent assessment of the transaction in light of its own circumstances and**
**determine with its own professional advisers any suitability or appropriateness implications of the transaction.**

**The primary market variables used for determining the mark-to-market value along with their directional impact are listed**
**below for information purposes only and is subject to change. Each directional impact assumes that the variable under**
**consideration moves from its current position while all other variables are kept constant. The directional impact may no**
**longer hold if more than one variable is allowed to move from their current positions. The primary market variables used**
**for determining the mark-to-market value of the transaction as of Trade Date are listed below along with their directional**
**impact on the mark-to-market value. JPMorgan accepts no responsibility or liability whatsoever to any person in respect of**
**the information herein.**

*positive number implies gain to the client. Client can perform linear interpolation to calculate the directional impact of change

in pricing variable for respective date. For e.g. for a Forward with 18 month maturity, the impact of a 1 INR per USD upward
move in spot will be average of the 1y and 2y.

For FCY INR trades, one can refer to sensitivity analysis in FCY USD and USD FCY Risk Disclosure Statement to calculate the
directional impact of change in pricing variables. For E.g. in case of FCY exports where USD is base currency,1% upmove in USD
INR and 1% down move in USD FCY can potentially have (-)2% impact on the MTM of FCY INR transaction. Similiary, in case of
FCY exports where USD is term currency,1% upmove in USD INR and 1% up move in FCY USD can potentially have (-)2% impact
on the MTM of FCY INR transaction.
